# Astro Ursa

<http://www.astroursa.space>

Space faring engineer from far away with a keen interest in alien technology while on a secret mission.

Looking for projects with a GPL type of license to work on during stream, preferably small or very modular and locally testable ones.  
Programming languages I am confident enough in are C#, TypeScript and Swift, I am also open for Rust projects as a learning experience. 

Feel free to reach out with any suggestions :)
